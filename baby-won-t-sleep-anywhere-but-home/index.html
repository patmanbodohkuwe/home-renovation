<p>The only way I. My baby is 6 weeks old and will not stay asleep anywhere unless being held - As soon as she is put down within 5 mins her eyes are wide open her arms and legs are kicking and shes screaming tried and tried to settle with no luck even tried to leave her a bit to. Im so tired and just dying for any kind of sleep but whenever I put her in her bassinet it takes no longer then 5-10. Cant get my 1 week old to sleep anywhere but on me or my partner or in someone elses arms- I know she is still very young but just u wondering if this is normal.
